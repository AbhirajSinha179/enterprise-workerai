Scaling your outbound email campaigns can exponentially grow your sales pipeline, but maintaining email deliverability is paramount. Ensuring your emails land in the inbox and not the spam folder requires a strategic approach. Here are essential tips to maintain deliverability while scaling your outbound emails.

### 1. Set Up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC

To maintain a high deliverability rate, it's crucial to authenticate your emails. Setting up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols can significantly improve your email's chances of being delivered successfully.

- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework):** This protocol verifies that emails claiming to be from your domain are sent from authorized IP addresses. By setting up SPF, you help email servers confirm your emails' legitimacy.
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):** DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails, ensuring that the email content has not been altered during transit. This signature helps verify the email's origin.
- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance):** DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM by providing instructions to receiving mail servers on how to handle emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks. It also enables you to receive reports on your email authentication performance.

Implementing these protocols can dramatically enhance your email deliverability and protect your domain from being used in phishing or spam attacks.

### 2. Use a Separate Domain

To safeguard your primary domain’s reputation, use a separate domain specifically for outbound email campaigns. This practice isolates your primary business communications from potential deliverability issues related to high-volume outbound emails. Ensure this separate domain is properly set up with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to maintain its own positive reputation.

### 3. Warm Up Your Mailboxes

Warming up your mailboxes is a crucial step before initiating large-scale email campaigns. This process involves gradually increasing the number of emails sent to build a positive sending reputation. Tools like [Instantly.ai](http://instantly.ai/) or [Warmy.io](http://warmy.io/) can automate this process, sending a controlled number of emails initially and increasing the volume over time. A well-warmed mailbox helps establish trust with email service providers, reducing the likelihood of your emails being flagged as spam.

### 4. Limit to 3 Mailboxes Per Domain

Distributing your email load across multiple mailboxes helps manage sending volume and reduces the risk of any single mailbox being flagged for high activity. Use up to three mailboxes per domain to maintain a balanced and manageable email sending strategy. This approach also helps in maintaining a consistent sending volume across your outbound campaigns.

### 5. Cap Emails at 50 Per Mailbox Per Day

To avoid triggering spam filters, it’s essential to cap the number of emails sent per mailbox. Sending a maximum of 50 emails per day per mailbox is a safe threshold. This limit ensures a steady and controlled email flow, preventing sudden spikes that could harm your sending reputation.

### 6. Avoid Templated Emails

Personalization is key to successful email outreach. Avoid sending templated emails that appear identical to each recipient. Instead, use dynamic content to tailor each email based on the recipient’s role, company, and interests. Personalized emails are more engaging and less likely to be marked as spam, significantly improving your deliverability rates.

### Conclusion

Maintaining email deliverability while scaling your outbound campaigns requires a strategic approach. By setting up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, using a separate domain, warming up your mailboxes, limiting the number of mailboxes and emails per day, and avoiding templated emails, you can ensure your emails reach your prospects’ inboxes. Implement these best practices to maximize the effectiveness of your email campaigns and drive your sales growth.
